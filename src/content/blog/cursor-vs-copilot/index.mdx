# ⚔️ Cursor vs Copilot: An Honest Take from a Dev

As a backend developer passionate about clean systems and developer experience, I've spent **over a year with GitHub Copilot** in my day-to-day workflows. Whether building REST APIs in Go, navigating Kubernetes manifests, or tweaking SQL queries, Copilot has been a near-constant companion — quietly assisting, suggesting, and occasionally blowing my mind.

But recently, I decided to try **Cursor**, the new AI-powered code editor everyone’s buzzing about. After just a few days, I’ve got thoughts.

---

## 🧰 The Tools: What They Aim to Do

**GitHub Copilot**  
> A code completion assistant powered by OpenAI, Copilot plugs into your favorite IDE (VSCode, Neovim, JetBrains…) and helps suggest code snippets, functions, comments, tests — almost like pair programming with an AI that doesn’t sleep.

**Cursor**  
> A full-fledged code editor (a fork of VSCode) enhanced by native AI integration. Cursor takes things further by embedding AI *everywhere* — inline edits, commit messages, file explanations, and even multi-file refactoring flows. It’s like Copilot… but with the whole IDE tailored for AI.

## 💭 My Perspective

I'm a **big fan of Copilot** — it changed the way I write code. The experience feels fluid and familiar, like the editor is finishing my thoughts.

That said, I was genuinely curious to try Cursor. Everyone in the dev community seems to be giving it a spin lately, so I wanted to see what the fuss was about.

And to be honest: **Cursor is impressive.**

## 🔍 What Cursor Does *Really* Well

- **Navigation between files is exceptional**  
  Seriously. Jumping from one part of your codebase to another with AI-powered context is just *better* in Cursor.  
  Whether it's understanding a class, finding the next edit location, or getting a summary of a function — it’s built-in, fast, and intuitive.

- **Multi-step commands feel native**  
  Want to refactor a whole file? Ask Cursor. Need to understand the difference between two functions? Ask Cursor. It feels more like giving orders to an assistant who knows your codebase inside out.

- **Copilot is playing catch-up**  
  GitHub is introducing features like “Next Suggested Edit” — which is cool, but let’s be real: **Cursor nailed that already**.

---

## 💸 Pricing & Value

Here's where the scales tip.

- **Cursor’s pricing** is quite a bit steeper than Copilot’s.
- For devs like me who already get a ton of value from Copilot — it’s hard to justify the switch *purely* on price/performance ratio.
- If you’re on a budget or already happy with Copilot in your current stack, **the difference probably isn’t worth it** yet.

## 🏁 My Verdict

> I loved using Cursor.  
> I’ll probably go back to it from time to time.  
> But for now — **I’m sticking with Copilot**.

Copilot still integrates beautifully into my workflow, and with new features being rolled out regularly, I think it’ll continue improving fast. Cursor shows what’s possible — but for now, Copilot remains the best balance of **cost, speed, and support** in my dev toolbox.
