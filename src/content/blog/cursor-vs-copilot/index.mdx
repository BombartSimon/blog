      ⚔️ Cursor vs Copilot: An Honest Take from a Dev

      After one year of Copilot and a few days testing Cursor, here's my real experience

  </div>
</div>

As a backend developer passionate about clean systems and developer experience, I've spent **over a year with GitHub Copilot** in my day-to-day workflows. Whether building REST APIs in Go, navigating Kubernetes manifests, or tweaking SQL queries, Copilot has been a near-constant companion — quietly assisting, suggesting, and occasionally blowing my mind.

But recently, I decided to try **Cursor**, the new AI-powered code editor everyone's buzzing about. After just a few days, I've got thoughts.

## 🧰 The Tools: What They Aim to Do

<div style={{
  display: "grid",
  gridTemplateColumns: "repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr))",
  gap: "2rem",
  marginBottom: "2rem"
}}>

<div style={{
  padding: "2rem",
  background: "linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(36, 41, 46, 0.05) 0%, rgba(36, 41, 46, 0.1) 100%)",
  borderRadius: "1rem",
  border: "1px solid rgba(36, 41, 46, 0.2)",
  boxShadow: "0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"
}}>

### **GitHub Copilot** 🤖

A code completion assistant powered by OpenAI, Copilot plugs into your favorite IDE (VSCode, Neovim, JetBrains…) and helps suggest code snippets, functions, comments, tests — almost like pair programming with an AI that doesn't sleep.

</div>

<div style={{
  padding: "2rem",
  background: "linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.05) 0%, rgba(147, 51, 234, 0.05) 100%)",
  borderRadius: "1rem",
  border: "1px solid rgba(147, 51, 234, 0.2)",
  boxShadow: "0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"
}}>

### **Cursor** ✨

A full-fledged code editor (a fork of VSCode) enhanced by native AI integration. Cursor takes things further by embedding AI *everywhere* — inline edits, commit messages, file explanations, and even multi-file refactoring flows. It's like Copilot… but with the whole IDE tailored for AI.

## 💭 My Perspective

<div style={{
  padding: "2rem",
  background: "linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.05) 0%, rgba(101, 163, 13, 0.05) 100%)",
  borderRadius: "1rem",
  border: "1px solid rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.2)",
  marginBottom: "2rem"
}}>

I'm a **big fan of Copilot** — it changed the way I write code. The experience feels fluid and familiar, like the editor is finishing my thoughts.

That said, I was genuinely curious to try Cursor. Everyone in the dev community seems to be giving it a spin lately, so I wanted to see what the fuss was about.

And to be honest: **Cursor is impressive.**

## 🔍 What Cursor Does *Really* Well

<div style={{
  display: "grid",
  gap: "1.5rem",
  marginBottom: "2rem"
}}>

<div style={{
  padding: "1.5rem",
  background: "linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.05) 0%, rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.05) 100%)",
  borderRadius: "1rem",
  border: "1px solid rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.2)",
  borderLeft: "4px solid rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.5)"
}}>

### 🚀 **Navigation between files is exceptional**
Seriously. Jumping from one part of your codebase to another with AI-powered context is just *better* in Cursor. Whether it's understanding a class, finding the next edit location, or getting a summary of a function — it's built-in, fast, and intuitive.

</div>

<div style={{
  padding: "1.5rem",
  background: "linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(168, 85, 247, 0.05) 0%, rgba(236, 72, 153, 0.05) 100%)",
  borderRadius: "1rem",
  border: "1px solid rgba(168, 85, 247, 0.2)",
  borderLeft: "4px solid rgba(168, 85, 247, 0.5)"
}}>

### ⚙️ **Multi-step commands feel native**
Want to refactor a whole file? Ask Cursor. Need to understand the difference between two functions? Ask Cursor. It feels more like giving orders to an assistant who knows your codebase inside out.

</div>

<div style={{
  padding: "1.5rem",
  background: "linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(244, 63, 94, 0.05) 0%, rgba(251, 146, 60, 0.05) 100%)",
  borderRadius: "1rem",
  border: "1px solid rgba(244, 63, 94, 0.2)",
  borderLeft: "4px solid rgba(244, 63, 94, 0.5)"
}}>

### 🏃‍♂️ **Copilot is playing catch-up**
GitHub is introducing features like "Next Suggested Edit" — which is cool, but let's be real: **Cursor nailed that already**.

## 💸 Pricing & Value

<div style={{
  padding: "2rem",
  background: "linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(251, 146, 60, 0.05) 0%, rgba(244, 63, 94, 0.05) 100%)",
  borderRadius: "1rem",
  border: "1px solid rgba(251, 146, 60, 0.2)",
  marginBottom: "2rem"
}}>

Here's where the scales tip.

- **Cursor's pricing** is quite a bit steeper than Copilot's.
- For devs like me who already get a ton of value from Copilot — it's hard to justify the switch *purely* on price/performance ratio.
- If you're on a budget or already happy with Copilot in your current stack, **the difference probably isn't worth it** yet.

## 🏁 My Verdict

<div style={{
  padding: "2.5rem",
  background: "linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.1) 0%, rgba(168, 85, 247, 0.1) 100%)",
  borderRadius: "1.5rem",
  border: "2px solid rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.3)",
  textAlign: "center",
  marginBottom: "3rem",
  position: "relative"
}}>

<div style={{
  fontSize: "1.5rem",
  fontWeight: "bold",
  marginBottom: "1.5rem",
  color: "rgba(99, 102, 241, 1)"
}}>
  🏆 The Final Word
</div>

<div style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem", lineHeight: "1.7" }}>
  I loved using Cursor.<br />
  I'll probably go back to it from time to time.<br />
  But for now — **I'm sticking with Copilot**.
</div>

<div style={{
  marginTop: "1.5rem",
  padding: "1rem",
  background: "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)",
  borderRadius: "0.5rem",
  fontSize: "0.95rem"
}}>
  Copilot still integrates beautifully into my workflow, and with new features being rolled out regularly, I think it'll continue improving fast. Cursor shows what's possible — but for now, Copilot remains the best balance of **cost, speed, and support** in my dev toolbox.
